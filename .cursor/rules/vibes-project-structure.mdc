# Vibes - Minimal Web App Project Structure

## Project Overview
Vibes is a minimal, bi-color web app built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and modern CSS. The project focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and clean design using only black and white colors that adapt to system theme.

## Project Philosophy

- **Bi-color**: Only use black (#000000) and white (#ffffff)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first, clean design
- **Modern**: Use latest CSS features and clean typography
- **Web-first**: Standard web app with modern browser features
